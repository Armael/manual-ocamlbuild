I intend this document to be licensed as widely as possible -- but I'm
not yet fixed on the final license, given that it's a text document
rather than a software. A reasonable choice would be the CC0 license
of Creative COmmons, emulating Public Domain as closely as possible.

I will consider any (warmly welcome) explicit contribution to this
documentation effort to be contributed under the public domain or
CC0. Do not silently send me patches or pull requests if you disagree
with that choice.
